# Introduction

Porting over my sportsbook AI project that I generally did not put into source control. I decided to scrap that project, use the concepts I was using in that project, and build a better project from that. I am going to start with the WNBA and UFL seasons since I am dealing with a lot less teams and therefore, a lot less data.
